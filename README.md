# Instagram_Reach_Prediction
In this project, I have performed the analysis on Instagram data. I had some interesting questions in mind before starting with the analysis.
The analysis depicts the relationships between the likes,saves,comments,shares etc. I wanted to know whether or not there is any interesting relationship between how well the post did in terms of engagements and the number of likes it fetched, number of comments and shares it got. How many users visited the profile due to any engagement with the post, etc. 

This could be applicable(with some space for data scraping and modelling) to any platform user data in order to understand the user behaviours. The potential use cases could be formulating effective marketing campaigns to target a particular set of customers.
